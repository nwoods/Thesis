\section{Acknowledgements}

% They say it takes a village to raise a child, and a grad student is just a toddler whose grape juice has fermented, so I have many people to thank.
% I am indebted to too many advisors, colleagues, and friends to name them all here, so I will highlight just a few for particular appreciation; the many omissions are solely for the purpose of keeping this document under 200 pages.

% The members of the Wisconsin CMS group have taught me an enormous amount about physics and essentially everything else.
