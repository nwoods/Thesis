Several studies of four-lepton production in proton-proton collisions are presented.
The dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity {35.9\fbinv} at a center-of-mass energy of {13\TeV}, collected by the CMS detector at the LHC\@.
All reported measurements use the $2\ell2\ell'$ final states, where $\ell, \ell' = \Pe$ or $\Pm$.
The total {\ZZ} cross section for all events with two {\PZ} bosons in the mass range {60--120\GeV} is measured and found to be $\sigma(\pp \to \ZZ) = 17.2 \pm 0.5 \stat \pm 0.7 \syst \pm 0.4 \thy \pm 0.4 \lum \unit{pb}$.
The {\PZ} branching fraction to four leptons is found to be $\mathcal{B}\left(\Zfourl\right) = 4.8 \pm 0.2 \stat \pm 0.2 \syst \pm 0.1 \thy \pm 0.1 \lum \times 10^{-6}$ for events with $80 < m_{4\ell} < 100\GeV$ and $m_{\ell\ell} > 4\GeV$ for all opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs.
Differential cross sections are measured as functions of a number of kinematic and jet-related observables.
All these results agree with standard model predictions.
A search for fully electroweak $\ZZ + 2\text{jets}$ production is performed, and an excess consistent with standard model vector boson scattering is found at the $2.7\sigma$ level.
Searches for anomalous triple and quartic gauge couplings are performed, and the four-lepton invariant mass distributions are used to set the most stringent limits to date on a number of parameters affecting neutral gauge boson interactions.
