\chapter{The Standard Model}

\section{Introduction}

The standard model (SM) is a theory---or rather, set of several related theories---that encapsulates everything we currently know about matter and its interactions at a fundamental level.
This is a remarkable claim: in the particle physicist's reductionist worldview, subatomic particle interactions are the substrate underlying the rest of reality, with all other physics, and by extension everything else, arising as emergent properties.
Of course, the SM is a remarkable theory, making detailed predictions on a wide range of topics that have matched data in essentially every experiment over roughly four decades.
The small number of known phenomena outside the SM are topics on which it makes no prediction; it is fully self-consistent and on the topics it covers, it is consistent with data to the precision achievable by any experiment to date.
It is arguably the best-confirmed theory in the history of science despite making some of the boldest, broadest, and most precise predictions.
It is generally believed that future advances will add to it, explain its free parameters, or find some underlying structure, not contradict it.

The following sections give a general overview of the SM and related topics that serve as background material for the four-lepton processes described in more detail in the following chapters.
This will include discussions of the particle content of the SM and the gauge structure that leads to particle interactions, the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism that leads to the specific structure of the electroweak sector of the SM, diboson processes, and the SM's limitations and how they might be addressed.
Some details will also be given about the proton-proton interactions used to probe particle interactions at high energies.
More complete information may be found in a number of texts, including Refs.~\cite{Griffiths:111880,Halzen:1984mc,Peskin:1995ev}.
Detailed treatment of the mathematical and field theoretical underpinnings of particle physics, including the theory's aesthetically pleasing grounding in natural symmetries, is also discussed in a number of books, including Refs.~\cite{Halzen:1984mc,Peskin:1995ev,Srednicki:1019751,Donoghue:238727}.
Unless otherwise stated, everything that follows uses units such that $c = \hbar = 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant $\hbar = h / 2\pi$.



\section{Matter and Force}

In the SM, matter is made of fermions (particles with half-integer spin; in fact all SM fundamental fermions have spin $\frac{1}{2}$) which interact by exchanging gauge bosons (integer spin; spin 1 for the SM force carriers).
The fermions come in two broad categories, leptons and quarks.
All the quarks and half the lepton types carry electric charge and are therefore subject to interactions through the electromagnetic force, described by quantum electrodynamics (QED).
In a QED interaction, two charged particles exchange a photon, which carries the momentum transferred from one charged particle to the other.
The photon is a spin-1 gauge boson that is electrically neutral itself and massless, explaining why electromagnetic forces are long-range.
Because it is so simple, QED was the first theory of fundamental force to be worked out in detail, and it served as the template for the theories of the other forces.
The Feynman diagram at leading order (LO) in perturbation theory for a simple QED interaction, the so-called Drell-Yan process, in which a fermion-antifermion pair ($\Pf\Paf$, where {\Pf} can be any charged fermion) annihilates and produces a different pair ($\Pf'\Paf'$) is shown in in Fig.~\ref{fig:drellYanDiagram}.
Our conventions for Feynman diagrams will be that time increases from left to right, fermions are straight lines with an arrow whose direction differentiates fermions (arrow points right) from antifermions (arrow points left), and photons are shown as wavy lines.

There are six types of quarks which fall into three ``generations:'' up and down ({\Pqu} and {\Pqd}, first generation); charm and strange ({\Pqc} and {\Pqs}, second generation); and top and bottom ({\Pqt} and {\Pqb})\footnote{Top and bottom quarks are sometimes called truth and beauty by more romantic particle physicists.}.
Quark masses increase with each successive generation.
Up-type quarks ({\Pqu}, {\Pqc}, {\Pqt}) have electric charge $+2/3$ (in units of the positron charge) while down-type quarks have $-1/3$.
Quarks are the building blocks of hadron, including $\Pq\Paq'$ bound states called mesons and $\Pq\Pq'\Pq''/\Paq\Paq'\Paq''$ bound states called baryons, of which protons ($\Pqu\Pqu\Pqd$) and neutrons ($\Pqu\Pqd\Pqd$) are the most familiar.
Top quarks are too heavy to form bound states; they decay too quickly.
Hadrons are bound by the strong nuclear force, described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

The mediator for the strong force is the gluon, which like the photon is a massless spin-1 gauge boson.
The analog of electric charge is color charge, a notion originally introduced to explain how identical quarks could exist in the symmetric bound state of a hadron despite the Fermi exclusion principle~\cite{Griffiths:111880}.
Unlike electric charge, there are three types of color charge, typically called red, green, and blue, though these names are totally arbitrary\footnote{Negative color charges are typically called simply antired, antigreen and antiblue, but sometimes cyan, magenta and yellow, to continue the analogy with visible colors.}.
The analogy with color comes primary from the heuristic that natural states must ``colorless,'' i.e.\ a hadron may have equal parts color and corresponding anticolor as in a meson, but it may also be ``white,'' containing red, blue, and green in equal measures as in a baryon.
This propery, known as confinement, is why, for example, $\Pq\Pq\Paq$ bound states are not seen in nature.
It is also why a free quark has never been observed, and is not expected to be found, and why the strong interaction is short-range even though gluons are massless.

Confinement arises from the structure of QCD interactions and gluons themselves.
Among fermions, only quarks interact through the strong force, but gluons also carry color charge and interact with each other.
Because gluons interact with each other, do not have a distinct antiparticle, and are massless, they can split and radiate infinitely.
The resulting soft gluon interactions around quarks lead to an anti-screening effect that causes the strength of the strong force to change as a function of the distance between interacting quarks, with close quarks interacting less strongly as far as a single gluon exchange is concerned.
The origin of confinement is that as quark separation gets larger, the potential energy of strong interactions rises rapidly, until it is energetically favorable for the gluon connecting them to split into a $\Pq\Paq$ pair that screens them and effectively breaks off the interaction.
This enforces the requirement of colorless states: a single colored particle will cause more colored particles to be produced from vacuum until only colorless bound states remain.
This process is known as hadronization, and causes single quarks or gluons leaving a hard scattering interaction to make ``jets'' of many hadrons, each carrying a fraction of the original parton momentum, that enter the detector together.
Conversely, close-range QCD is relatively feeble, leading to ``asymptotic freedom,'' the property of partons within hadrons that they may be considered independent in high-energy collisions, because their interactions are weak enough that bound state effects may be neglected (see Section~\ref{sec:pp}).

Leptons may be electrically charged or neutral, and come in three generations, each containing one lepton of each type, a charged lepton and a corresponding neutrino.
In order of charged lepton mass, the generations are the electron and its neutrino ({\Pe} and {\Pne}), muon and its neutrino ({\Pm} and {\Pnm}), and tau and its neutrino ({\Pt} and {\Pnt}).
Taus decay quickly, with a mean lifetime of $2.9 \times 10^{-13}\unit{s}$ in their rest frame; muons also decay, but their lifetime ($2.2\unit{\mu s}$) is long compared to other time scales involved in particle collider experiments, so they are considered stable particles for the purposes of this work.
Neutrinos are known to have mass~\cite{Fukuda:1998mi,Ahmad:2001an,Ahmad:2002jz}, and the masses are known to be small but they have not been measured.
All leptons and quarks interact via the weak nuclear force, which is best known for causing the nuclear beta decay reaction $\Pn \to \Pp + \Pe^- + \Pane$.
Neutrinos are notable for interacting only through weak interactions, making them difficult to detect in practice.
Detectors at particle colliders make no attempt to detect neutrinos, and their involvement in the process is inferred only through the apparent momentum imbalance resulting from their absence.

There are two types of weak interactions, charged-current and neutral-current interactions.
Neutral-current interactions proceed through exchange of an electrically neutral {\PZ} boson, which is analogous to electromagnetic interactions except for two important differences.
Unlike the {\Pa}, the {\PZ} boson has mass, giving it longitudinal polarization modes and limiting the range of the force because it decays with a halflife on the order of $10^{-25}\unit{s}$.
Also unlike QED, weak interactions do not respect parity (P) symmetry.
The {\PZ} boson couples more strongly to left-handed fermions (those with helicity opposite their direction of motion) and right-handed antiparticles than to their opposite-spin counterparts.
The degree of asymmetry varies by fermion type; notably, the {\PZ} does not couple at all to right-handed neutrinos.
Neutral-current interactions are still symmetric under combined charge conjugation (C) and parity (CP) transformations.
The neutral weak force leads to a Feynman diagram which looks exactly like that of Fig.~\ref{fig:drellYanDiagram}, which in fact implies that Feg.~\ref{fig:drellYanDiagram} is an oversimplification, or at least an approximation valid only for center-of-mass energies significantly below the {\PZ} boson mass, because the electromagnetic and neutral-current weak interactions interfere.

Charged-current interaction proceed through exchange of an electrically charged {\PW} boson.
Leptons couple to {\PWm} bosons in $\ell^-, \Panl$ pairs ({\PWp} bosons likewise with their antiparticles), causing {\Pm} and {\Pt} decays.
Lepton flavor in conserved in the sense that charged leptons couple to the {\PW} only in conjunction with the (anti-)neutrino from the same generation, so the total lepton number $N_\ell = n_{\ell^-} - n_{\ell^+} + n_{\Pnl} - n_{\Panl}$, where $n_\PX$ is the number of {\PX} particles in existence, is conserved separately for $\ell \in \left(\Pe, \Pm, \Pt \right)$. % chktex 36
Flavor conservation does not hold for quarks undergoing charged weak interactions.
An up-type quark always couples to the {\PW} in conjunction with a down-type quark, as it must to obey conservation of electric and color charge.
While the pairings are most often within a generation, they are in general described by a unitary $3 \times 3$ matrix known as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix.
