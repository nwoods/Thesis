\chapter{The Standard Model}

\section{Introduction}
Some history and stuff



\section{Matter and Force}
Does this need subsections? Not the way it's structured in my head right now, but maybe it could have one subsection for fermions and another for gauge bosons.



\section{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs Boson}
Everybody's favorite fundamental scalar boson



\section{Proton-Proton Collisions}
\label{sec:pp}
Bang



\section{Diboson Physics}
Really only ZZ, but you get the point

\subsection{Vector Boson Scattering}
Scatter scatter


\section{Limitations and Possible Extensions}
It misses a few things

\subsection{Anomalous Gauge Couplings}
Pro tip: we won't see them
